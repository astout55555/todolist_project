# todolist_project

This is my first project being packaged as a Rubygem. However, as this was part of a tutorial on the process, and not a unique gem, it will not be released.

This gem was built as part of my coursework for RB130, a course at Launch School, and online school for software engineering. Final .rb files are exact copies of the solutions provided by LS.
